# ROLLING-DICE
## DESCRIPTION
This project is for system's programming in C language.
This project uses the sense hatâ€™s inputs and the sense hats led matrix. The project uses the libsense library.

1. The program simulates a set of four 6 sided dice. To roll the dice, the user will shake the raspberry pi. 
2. Using the accelerometer, your program will detect this shaking and select 4 random numbers between 1 and 6.  
3. The program then draws the two dice on the screen as dots (requires 3x3, so 4 dice will fit on the screen). 
4. The program uses pressing down on the joystick to change the color of the dots (and redraw the current screen in the new color).  5.
5. The program should exit cleanly on ctrl-c.
